<p>Xamarin is a platform for developing cross-platform mobile applications. It allows developers to use C# and the .NET framework to build mobile applications that can run on various operating systems, including iOS and Android. Xamarin uses a single codebase to target multiple platforms, which can save time and resources compared to developing separate native applications for each platform.</p>
